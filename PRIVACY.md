# Privacy Policy for shoutless

**Developer:** Voidcat 
**App Name:** shoutless
**Effective Date:** 11/10/2025

Voidcat ("us", "we", or "our") operates the shoutless mobile application (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Service.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. The shoutless app is designed to be simple and to collect the absolute minimum data necessary to function and improve.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from you. The app does not ask for, or have access to, your name, email address, phone number, location, photos, or contacts.

The only data collection that occurs is through the following services:

1. Google Play Store The app is distributed through the Google Play Store, which is operated by Google. Your download and installation of the app are subject to the Google Play Store's terms of service and privacy policy. Google may collect data related to your download, but this data is managed by Google and not by shoutless.

    Link to Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

2. Firebase Crashlytics To help us identify and fix bugs, we use a third-party service called Firebase Crashlytics, which is a Google product.

If the app crashes while you are using it, Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects a crash report. This report contains non-personal information about the crash, which may include:

    Device type (e.g., "Pixel 7")

    Operating system version (e.g., "Android 14")

    The app's state at the time of the crash

    Other diagnostic data related to the crash

This information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. We use this data solely for the purpose of diagnosing and fixing bugs to improve the stability and performance of the app.

## How We Use Your Information

The non-personal crash report data collected by Firebase Crashlytics is used only to:

    Identify the cause of crashes and bugs.

    Improve the app's stability for all users.

## Data Security

The security of your data is important to us. The non-personal crash data collected by Firebase Crashlytics is handled securely by Google. We trust in their robust security measures to protect this information. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since our app does not collect any personal information at all, we do not (and cannot) collect such information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page (or a link to it within the app or on our Google Play Store listing).

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
